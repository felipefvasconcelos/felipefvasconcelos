# üëãüèº Hello! Welcome to my GitHub!

Here you will find some cool Data Science projects developed with public data and theoretical business problems. Be my guest to take a look into my repositories and to get in touch by the channels down below.

## üíª Work Profile

üë∑üèΩ I'm gratuated in Mechanical Engineering and currently work as maintenance planning and controlling analyst at and dairy industry. I also study and develope data science projects using machine learning models to solve problems and create value to business.

üéØ My goal is to work full time as a Data Scientist, developing valuable solutions through analytical tools, machine learning techniques and statistics to solve problems.

## Projects
### [E-commerce Clustering](https://github.com/felipefvasconcelos/insiders_clustering)

Being able to identify and label the most valuable customers allows companies to better understand desirable behaviours and take actions in order to maximize profit. In this project I use K-Means algorithm and embedding spaces to create customer clusters for an E-commerce company.

### [Insurance Cross Sell Ranking Model](https://github.com/felipefvasconcelos/insurance_cross_sell)

A good approach for a company to increase revenue is to offer its customer base a new product. But how to maximize sales conversion based on customers information? In the project I use Gradient Boosting Classifier to assign probability of each customer to buy a new product, based on previous survey information, and order them by the highest score. The model presented a recall of 0.57 and a performance 3 times better than random selection.

### [Sales Forecast](https://github.com/felipefvasconcelos/Rossman_Sales_Prediction)
Predicting sales with good accuracy is a fundamental requirement for any company to properly plan its operations. In this project I use XGBoost Regressor to predict with 90% accuracy the sales of a number of stores across Europe.

### [Real State Insights](https://github.com/felipefvasconcelos/House_Rocket_Insight_Project)

Proper data analys can provide valuable insights for any business decision making. In this project I use python as main tool to analyse data from real state market in King County (USA).
